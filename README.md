## Employed Models:

* Jukemir: https://github.com/p-lambda/jukemir
* Mule: https://github.com/PandoraMedia/music-audio-representations
* MERT: https://github.com/yizhilll/MERT

# Dataset description

The resulting dataset is formed by a main file in CSV format in which the features of all the files are displayed. These features are the following:

- **Name**: it contains the name or title of the tune.

- **Source**: determines the source from which the tune was extracted, ITMA or TheSession.

- **URL**: web link to the tune where you can see more information about it.

- **Genre**: musical genre of the song.

- **Filename**: the name of the file; this name is used in each of the formats in which the dataset is provided (ABC, MusicXML, MIDI, and WAV).

- **Embedding\_jukemir**: contains the embedding generated by the Jukemir model of the first 30 seconds of the tune it is an array of 4800 dimensions.

- **Embedding\_mule**: contains the embedding generated by the MULE model for the first 30 seconds of the tune; it is an array of 1728 dimensions.

- **Embedding\_mert**: contains the embedding generated by the MERT model for the first 30 seconds of the tune; this is an array of 1024 dimensions.
